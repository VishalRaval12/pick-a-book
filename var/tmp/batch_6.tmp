The 3 Mistakes of My Life traces the lives of three close friends, Govind, Omi and Ishan, in Gujarat. It chronicles the delightful and tragic tale of these young men as they embark on a journey to find success in their lives and careers. Govind has forever cherished a dream of setting up his own business, while Omi and Ishaan have always been relatively laid back in life. Together they start a cricket shop. Instead of focusing on the business, Ishaan aspires to mentor a gifted batsman, Ali. Omi, on the other hand, is not very opportunistic and ambitious and his only aim in life is to be there for his friends and support them in all their endeavors. However, nothing comes easy in life especially when you are stuck in a city which is caught up in chaos and turmoil. To realize their dreams, the boys have to face the worst of the circumstances – communal riots, massive earthquake, religious politics, and above all they have to bear the brunt of all their mistakes. Will the boys be able to come out triumphant from this messy situation? Three Mistakes of My Lifewas adapted into a movie called Kai Po Che! which was directed by Abhishek Kapoor.

Narayan was a pioneer of English writing in India. He still represents the face of Indian writing in English the world over, and is popular for his interesting characters and ethnic stories that painted a fascinating picture of the pre-independence and post-independence India. My Days traces Narayan's life journey up to the point when he became a well-established writer. It starts with his childhood days and proceeds on to his struggle to find a publisher, and then his ensuing success and popularity. R.K. Narayan grew up at his grandmother's house in Madras. He remembers the days he spent in the garden of the house playing with his pet peacock, his first experiences of school, initial fear of the teachers, and trying to be as unnoticeable as possible. He then describes his life in Mysore, his college days there, and his long walks in the city, especially around the Chamundi Hills. This begins another phase in his life, as he settles down in the beautiful city. He becomes a teacher after graduation. Meanwhile, in spite of the opposition from his father, he tries to establish himself as a writer. Although he failed to find a publisher initially, his manuscript of the now celebrated Swami and Friends had come to the attention of writer Graham Greene, who had convinced his publisher to pick up the book. R.K. Narayan also shares his poignant love story. His married bliss with Rajam ends in tragedy when she dies a few years later from typhoid. He talks about his time in the US, when he visited the country at the invitation of the Rockefeller Foundation. It was during this period that he wrote The Guide, which was also made into a major Hindi feature film. My Days is an interesting and compelling memoir of a literary genius","""I am inclined to call this the last chapter, but how can an autobiography have a final chapter? At best, it can only be a penultimate one; nor can it be given a rounded-off conclusion, as is possible in a work of fiction."" So begins the last chapter of My Days, the only memoir from R. K. Narayan, hailed as ""India's most notable novelist and short-story writer"" by the New York Times Book Review.",,,1/24/2017 0:00,,,,,,10,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,,,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,My Days : Autobiography,0,downloadable,,,Samples,Links,,pink,1,1,,,,,,,,,

Revolution 2020 (Hindi) is a satire on the education system in the country and revolves around the life of a young boy called Gopal and two of his friends, Aarti and Raghav. The story also covers most classes of the Indian society since Gopal comes from a poor setting, Raghav from a middle class family, and Arti from a high class political background. The story is based on how the three friends set out to achieve their respective ambitions in life and how it all ultimately turns out.
 
Gopal fails consistently in securing an admission into one of the premier institutes for engineering in the country and ultimately gives it up, while Raghav secures an admission into IT BHU even though all he wants to do is be a journalist and bring about change. While Gopal prepares for his exams, the love of his life, Aarti and his friend, Raghav become romantically involved.
 
The book traces the fate of the friends as they struggle to gain a footing in the world and try to achieve what they think is the best for themselves. Revolution 2020 (Hindi) is the Hindi translation of an English novel by the same title authored by Chetan Bhagat and was published in 2011.

Chetan Bhagat's 2 States is the author's personal account of the challenges that he and his wife faced in convincing their parents to agree to their love marriage. The novel is a hilarious take on the complications that arise within Indian families, especially when youngsters from diverse backgrounds fall in love and decide to tie the knot. As Bhagat aptly portrays, not only should the couple be willing to wed, but their families have to accept the union too! Bhagat leads his readers through the love story of Ananya and Krish, who belong to two culturally diverse states in India. They fall deeply in love during their time together in college, and as time goes on, they decide to get married. To be happily married ever after, though, they have an arduous task ahead. They have to persuade their parents, and for this, Krish must figure out a way to fit into a traditional south Indian household, and Ananya must try and compete with her Punjabi counterparts. Bhagat belts out a quirky and witty novel that's peppered with humor, and the contrast of a Punjabi and Tamilian household is brought out through this book.","Publisher	                Rupa & Co

I have one request. I never write an essay or discuss an Indian problem without proposing a solution, no matter how simple that resolution may sound. I urge you to do the same when you discuss a national issue anywhere. Let us not only complain and whine, but understand things and work them out.
Also, I am not perfect, nor are all my thoughts in every section in this book perfect. But let this book be a starting point. Let it generate more ideas about how we can turn our shared dream into a reality. Disagree with me, but at least havea point of view about the problem and a solution in mind. Do that, and in my eyes you will be what I call an awesome reader. And when we will have enough awesome readers who care about our country, nothing can stop us from Making India Awesome!
The average Indian anywhere in the country is looking for a better quality of life, a certain amount of hope and security and the freedom to make personal choices. The issues that really matter to us are the same. Differences exist, but they don’t run as deep as our politicians would have us believe. A Maharashtrian father wants a good college for his son and doesn’t care whether his MP is a Maharashtrian. An Assamese girl wants the freedom to marry her boyfriend, as does a woman in Karnataka.
This similarity of aspirations, at a fundamental level, is what gives me hope. It offers me—and others like me on a national platform—an opportunity to connect everyone. While fiction is fun and entertaining, writers like me also need to share common concerns with the population and propose a few deliverables.

Transforming society’s values is especially important. Let’s take an example. If we want to eradicate the menace of corruption, every dishonest act must create deep revulsion within us. Fighting corruption is not restricted to naming and shaming a few corrupt officials. If we think it is okay to cheat in exams, lie to a ticket collector in the train about our kids’ ages and pay a bit of money to avoid a big traffic fine, then at some level we clearly don’t care about eliminating corruption all that much. At best, we hate the politician who gets to steal (while we don’t).
It has been over a year since Modi won the 2014 Lok Sabha elections. What’s amazing is that the criticism has not stopped even as the Godhra riots’ censure has subsided. Anyhow, one thing is clear—Modi’s political graph has continued to rise. Even the always-righteous-but-not-always-right Arvind Kejriwal, who has successfully tarnished many reputations so far—Nitin Gadkari, Robert Vadra, Mukesh Ambani, Sheila Dikshit, to name a few—has been unable to really puncture the Modi effect. As he enters his second year in office, Modi’s popularity has not nose-dived, as so often happens with politicians who are voted into office with landslide majorities by voters who think that these leaders are their new messiahs.","Publisher	               Rupa Publications India

Many writers are successful at expressing what’s in their hearts or articulating a particular point of view. Chetan Bhagat’s books do both and more - A.R. Rahman, in TIME magazine, on Chetan’s inclusion in the TIME 100 Most Influential People in the World

I have one request. I never write an essay or discuss an Indian problem without proposing a solution, no matter how simple that resolution may sound. I urge you to do the same when you discuss a national issue anywhere. Let us not only complain and whine, but understand things and work them out.
Also, I am not perfect, nor are all my thoughts in every section in this book perfect. But let this book be a starting point. Let it generate more ideas about how we can turn our shared dream into a reality. Disagree with me, but at least havea point of view about the problem and a solution in mind. Do that, and in my eyes you will be what I call an awesome reader. And when we will have enough awesome readers who care about our country, nothing can stop us from Making India Awesome!
The average Indian anywhere in the country is looking for a better quality of life, a certain amount of hope and security and the freedom to make personal choices. The issues that really matter to us are the same. Differences exist, but they don’t run as deep as our politicians would have us believe. A Maharashtrian father wants a good college for his son and doesn’t care whether his MP is a Maharashtrian. An Assamese girl wants the freedom to marry her boyfriend, as does a woman in Karnataka.
This similarity of aspirations, at a fundamental level, is what gives me hope. It offers me—and others like me on a national platform—an opportunity to connect everyone. While fiction is fun and entertaining, writers like me also need to share common concerns with the population and propose a few deliverables.

Transforming society’s values is especially important. Let’s take an example. If we want to eradicate the menace of corruption, every dishonest act must create deep revulsion within us. Fighting corruption is not restricted to naming and shaming a few corrupt officials. If we think it is okay to cheat in exams, lie to a ticket collector in the train about our kids’ ages and pay a bit of money to avoid a big traffic fine, then at some level we clearly don’t care about eliminating corruption all that much. At best, we hate the politician who gets to steal (while we don’t).
It has been over a year since Modi won the 2014 Lok Sabha elections. What’s amazing is that the criticism has not stopped even as the Godhra riots’ censure has subsided. Anyhow, one thing is clear—Modi’s political graph has continued to rise. Even the always-righteous-but-not-always-right Arvind Kejriwal, who has successfully tarnished many reputations so far—Nitin Gadkari, Robert Vadra, Mukesh Ambani, Sheila Dikshit, to name a few—has been unable to really puncture the Modi effect. As he enters his second year in office, Modi’s popularity has not nose-dived, as so often happens with politicians who are voted into office with landslide majorities by voters who think that these leaders are their new messiahs.","Publisher	               Rupa Publications India

As if for the first time, he watches himself rise to the heights of Bomaby's commercial cinema from unremarkable beginnings, and encounter again all the people he met and used along the way... As a backdrop to these characters is an endless carousel of the major hits he's acted in-guady, exuberant, beguiling- a never ending fantasy that (as be realizes now, when he is unable to redeem a single moment) took over his life completely and transformed it into an astonishing, compelling lie. Show Business is many books rolle dinto one-it is a story about the telling of stories, it is a wonderfully funny tale about the romance and folly of cinema, it is a novel on an epic scale of ambition, greed love, deception and death. And, perhaps most important, it is a fable for our time which teaches us that we live in a world where illusion is the only reality and nothing is what is seems.

In the pursuit of material accomplishments and tangibles, people often forget their inner voice. This is where Robin Sharma steps in with this self help book.
What about the pursuit of happiness then? For everyone looking for inspiration to lead a more meaningful life and seeking out newer horizons that seem far away, this book takes them on a life altering journey. The method employed by Robin Sharma is making readers look at life with a glass half full approach that is infinitely more rewarding.
 
The book has a number of lessons that are bound to push readers into a more thoughtful plane from where self discovery is the inevitable goal. Sharma eggs readers into truly discovering their calling through one lesson. Another deals with deeming troubles as blessings instead. In another chapter, he asks readers to enjoy not just the end but also the journey that leads to the final objective. The stories are more often than not employed with a number of personal observations and experiences which render the content more real.
 
The chapter “Speaking kind words” is a simple take on responsibility towards other people and in exploring the power of affirmation. Some other chapters involve the concepts behind diverse matter like “Find three great friends” and “Use your commute time'. The chapters are short, but carry a lot of life affirming lessons that work as a refresher to whet the appetite of any wandering mind to think more deeply about the content at leisure.
 
Who Will Cry When You Die? is a book for anyone who wishes to live a beautiful and fulfilled life. The book was published in 1999.

Today the issues related to natural resource exploitation, consequences, their conservation, preservation and management leading to sustainable development have become the major thrust areas of teaching and research. Also, sustainability of natural resources, especially water and land resources, and their efficient use is one of the core programmes of Government of India’s Twelfth Five Year Plan (2012-2017) for strategic development; this objective can only be achieved if the resources are used judiciously. Although land and water resources-the focus of the present book-are vital for human survival and development, unfortunately both are under threat and are increasing strain worldwide. These resources have wide and significantly varying implications in rural and urban settlements, especially in India, where population has been continuously growing and, therefore, the demand of land and water is intensifying. This has necessitated urgent need for reviewing the availability of land and water resources and their conservation. Besides dealing with the theoretical aspects, this compendium presents case studies on natural resources as well, which reveal ground realities at micro and meso levels too. Pedagogical features like maps, diagrams, satellite imageries and latest database of the primary and secondary nature distinguish this book from other works on the subject. The book will be of immense use to postgraduate students and research scholars of geography and related disciplines such as rural-urban studies and environmental science. The thematic approach of the book provides reasonably good contents for cogitation to researchers. Policy makers, planners and academicians may also be benefitted while framing futuristic norms which may lead to sustainable development-the ultimate goal.AUDIENCE• Postgraduate students and Research Scholars of Geography.• Policy makers, Planners and Academicians",,,,1/25/2017 0:00,,,,,,100,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,,,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,Managing Natural Resources : Focus On Land And Water,0,downloadable,,,Samples,Links,,pink,0,,,,,,,,,,

Feminists disagree about what sexism consists in, and what exactly ought to be done about it; they disagree about what it means to be a woman or a man and what social and political implications gender has or should have. Nonetheless, motivated by the quest for social justice, feminist inquiry provides a wide range of perspectives on social, cultural, and political phenomena. Important topics for feminist theory and politics include: the body, class and work, disability, the family, globalization, human rights, popular culture, race and racism, reproduction, science, the self, sex work, and sexuality. The fallacy on which modern feminism is based is that men have more power than women. Among mammals, the female always has more power than the male, and humans are no exception. It is true that, in all human societies, men largely control all the money, politics, and prestige. They do, because they have to, in order to impress women.

According to the law of attraction, which governs everything in the universe, every individual draws those experiences, people, and events that match the frequency of the individual's thoughts and feelings. In other words, every individual can choose to adopt positive thinking to manifest the best of things in life, namely good health, lasting abundance, and supreme happiness. The author reveals how this fundamental principle of attraction has been scattered through the ages, finding its way into numerous cultures, traditions, philosophies, religions, and literature. She cites the examples of historical figures like Einstein, Galileo, Plato, and Leonardo da Vinci, who were purportedly aware of the Secret and used its exceptional power which eventually lead them to greatness. The book, simple in its approach, tries to unify ancient wisdom and New Thought to help readers explore their innate potential, and use it to manifest the reality of their dreams. It offers esoteric insight as well as practical advice to harness the power of positive thinking. The Secret was first published in 2006. It was based on the film of the same name which was released prior to the book. It sold more than 19 million copies in less than a year of its publication.
